# RepoMind Instructions for Codex

When working on this repo:
- Prefer small, testable steps.
- If you add a feature, add at least one test and one CLI example.
- Keep configuration in `repomind.config.yaml` + env vars.

When uncertain:
- Read docs in `docs/`
- Look for TODOs in `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Add a short note in `docs/DECISIONS.md` for important changes
